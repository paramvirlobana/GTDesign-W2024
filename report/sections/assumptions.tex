\section{Assumptions} \label{sec:assumptions}
The following assumptions are made \cite{saravanamuttoo2017}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A low value of $\psi$ leads to having more stages for a given turbine output. Hence, the objective will be to keep the value of $\psi$ from 3 to 5 based on current aircraft practices \cite{gt_theory}.
  \item A low value of $\phi$ leads to a larger annulus area for a given mass flow. A value of $\phi$ from 0.8 to 1.0 is recommended from literature \cite{gt_theory}.
  \item As an initial guess, a 50 per cent reaction design point is chosen while eliminating all values near 0 \cite{axialflowturbines}.
  \item Additionally, for jet propulsion, the swirl angle at the exit stage must be kept low since it leads to losses on the jet pipe and propelling nozzle \cite{farokhi2021aircraft}.
\end{itemize} 

\autoref{tab:designconstraints} summarizes some hard and soft design constraints that will be used during the
design process.
\input{tables/summary_des.tex}

\autoref{tab:additional_information} provides some values that have been chosen to solve the problem.
